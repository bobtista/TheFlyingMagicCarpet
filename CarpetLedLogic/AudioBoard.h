                      //have on/off control of leds via xSWx bits

//ON sets the beginning time of the turn-on slope. The on-time is relative to the selected 
//blinking cycle length. On-setting N (N = 0â€“15) sets the on-time to N/16 * cycle length.

//OFF sets the beginning time of the turn-off slope. Off-time is relative to blinking 
//cycle length in the same way as on-time.

//SLOPE sets the turn-on and turn-off slopes. Fastest slope is set by [0000] and slowest 
//by [1111]. SLOPE changes the duty cycle at constant, programmable rate. For each slope 
//setting the maximum slope time appears at maximum DUTY setting. When DUTY is reduced, 
//the slope time decreases proportionally. For example, in case of maximum DUTY, the sloping
//time can be adjusted from 31 ms [0000] to 930 ms [1111]. For DUTY [0111] the sloping time
//is 14 ms [0000] to 434 ms [1111]. The blinking cycle has no effect on SLOPE.

//DUTY sets the brightness of the LED by adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM driver. The 
//minimum DUTY cycle is 0% [0000] and the maximum in the flash mode is A 100% [1111]. 
//The peak pulse current is determined by the external resistor, LED forward voltage drop
//and the boost voltage. In the normal mode the maximum duty cycle is 33%.
